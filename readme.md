## Directions

1. Create a new repo, do not include a readme or license at this stage.  
2. Go to settings->Automatic Page Generator->Continue to Layouts and select the Tactile layout.  Click Publish.  On the following screen, note the url of your new page (it should be user-or-org-name.github.io/repository-name).  
3. Look at your published page and note the full url of the css files.  
4. Take the html of the index.html file and move the header and footer parts into '_includes' folder.  
5. Create the '_layout' file.  
6. Convert the index.html file to index.md with just markdown for the body and the proper header for such a file (see example).  
7. Create other pages using the same structure.
